    Isn’t it funny how the ignorant masses throw around phrases like ‘big
    brother’ and ‘1984’ to demonise any belief systems left of Blairism, when
    the author of these terms described himself as a Democratic Socialist?
  </p>
  <p class="lead" style="color: white">
    The mantra of the brain-dead conformist is that there is no alternative
    between Laissez-faire free markets and Communist totalitarian states. These
    people actually believe that freedom lies within the superfluous choice of
    consumption, rather then having any influence over Governmental policy. For
    them it is perfectly free and democratic to let a tiny minority of the top
    1% dictate policy at the expense of the disenfranchised policy, but suddenly
    a threat to their freedom when you want to introduce means by which the
    marginalized can get their say such as in unions or in regulations to uphold
    workers and consumer rights and stop the growing ‘precariat class’.
  </p>
  <p class="lead" style="color: white">
    These people are robots, everything that passes through their minds and
    comes out of their moves has been programmed into them through the corporate
    media. Don’t expect these people to care about anything except the latest
    handbag release, or lipstick, or football game, or beer, or the latest
    Hollywood movie. These people are weak idiots who have long ago surrendered
    their spirits and been turned into obedient soulless dead conformists to the
    liberal consumer culture.
  </p>
  <p class="lead" style="color: white">
    They bury their heads in the sand when you mention the zero-hour contracts,
    zero job security, rise of the ‘McJob’, increasing wealth inequality,
    stagnant wages despite increased profits and production, decreased unions,
    increased job losses and social values being perverted by crass materialism.
    But then quickly bury their heads out in the presence of a shiny new toy or
    game. ‘Look honey, Call of Duty 15 allows you to kill Rusike’s, wogs and
    gooks.’
  </p>
  <p class="lead" style="color: white">
    At best they concerned about the impending doom from the environmental
    catastrophe, but that is only because there is a lot of money to be made
    from corporations slapping a green USP on their products that come from a
    not so green economic system where profit is determined by how fast you can
    repeat the never ending cycle of taking from the earth to manufacture, sell,
    then dispose.
  </p>
  <p class="lead" style="color: white">
    But at worst they direct their frustration, not at the ruling plutocrats but
    at each other instead. The usual suspects are always to blame, immigrants,
    gypsies, Jews, aliens. They have even come up with a new boogieman, SJW.
    This whole process if of course a complete waste of time and achieves
    nothing but fuel the divide and rule process that diverts rightful blame
    away from the rich and the powerful.
  </p>
  <p class="lead" style="color: white">
    They have been led to believe by the corporate media that Socialism is
    Communism and Capitalism is free. These lies have been carefully constructed
    by the ruling classes to silence any productive discussion on how the
    capitalist system should be replaced. They conveniently ignore the fact that
    Bolshevism was a right-wing adoption of contemporary Marxism, seen through
    people like Rosa Luxembourg and Antonie Pannekoek.
  </p>
  <p class="lead" style="color: white">
    Yes, Soviet Russia did refer to itself as Socialist, but it also referred to
    itself as democratic. It was the job of what Edward Bernays would call ‘The
    invisible Government’ who are the true ruling powers of the west to accept
    only one of these spurious claims and disregard the other. The core
    principle of socialism is democratic control of production, something which
    the Soviet Union patiently lacked. Unfortunately, facts cease to matter when
    you want to misrepresent mass murderers to suit your own needs.
  </p>
  <p class="lead" style="color: white">
    Despite what you may have been led to believe workers controlling the means
    of production is the ultimate form of freedom. In fact, many enlightenment
    philosophers such as Wilhelm von Humboldt who originated what we now call
    ‘Classic Liberalism’ thought so too. There is nothing free about an economic
    system that has to goal other than achieving Adam Smith’s vile maxim of ‘All
    for ourselves, and nothing for other people’ and where citizens are turned
    into consumers who have to subjugate themselves to what Lowell Mill girls in
    the 19th century referred to as ‘Wage Slavery’.
  </p>
  <p class="lead" style="color: white">
    If we stop this, then we can be emancipated from wasted toil focused on
    benefitting what James Madison referred to as the ‘opulent of the minority’
    at the expense of the majority, and take charge of the institutions so that
    we can master our own lives and forge our own destiny.
  </p>
  <p class="lead" style="color: white">
    If this sounds to utopian for you, then I would suggest that you go back to
    polluting your mind with sensory pleasure and vain, materialistic corporate
    entertainment designed to make you ugly like they are; and don’t ever
    attempt to think outside of the status quo again for your feeble,
    conditioned brain just might explode. For it is your thinking that makes
    change unlikely.
  </p>
  <p class="lead" style="color: white">
    Now that doesn’t mean that change should be handled by a messianic state who
    saves us from the evils of capitalism. That means change should be handled
    from the bottom up rather then the top down. For the Government does not run
    the country, they merely manage it and so power should be decentralized as
    much as possible to allow the true driving force behind the country to take
    back reigns of control.
  </p>
  <p class="lead" style="color: white">
    Of course, there is no blueprint of how this should be accomplished. But
    there needn’t be one, all that needs to happen is for the people to make the
    effort, and work towards a society dedicated to upholding the basic
    principles of democracy, solidarity, justice, peace and love. It is the job
    of power mad tyrants to mould society into the rudimentary framework that
    they think will be most beneficial. Both Lenin and Thatcher thought they
    knew what the perfect society should be, both were deeply misguided.
  </p>
  <p class="lead" style="color: white">
    I am going to list some suggestions as to what we should all be doing. They
    are not miracle workers, but they will galvanize change in the right
    direction and require little to no effort on your behalf.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li class="lead" style="color: white">
      Quit social media. It is linked to depression, suicide, bullying, eating
      disorders etc. Furthermore, its algorithms are trained to filter out
      information that could be subversive to the ruling classes.
    </li>
    <li class="lead" style="color: white">
      Instead of pointing out other people’s flaws, focus on solving your own
      flaws.
    </li>
    <li class="lead" style="color: white">
      Don’t buy things you don’t need. Economic growth in this system is founded
      upon people buying in excess, therefore if we don’t change then it won’t
      change.
    </li>
    <li class="lead" style="color: white">
      Quit all addictions. Everything from nicotine to smartphone addiction
      needs to stop. We cannot afford to be slaves to corporate consumption.
      Remember that they can replace you as a worker but they cannot replace a
      sale.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="lead" style="color: white">
    So, there you have it, the revolution comes from within. We cannot see any
    holistic change in society unless the necessary internal changes have
    happened first, and until they do happen then it will continue to look like
    there’s no alternative between Marxist-Leninism and free market Capitalism.
  </p>
  <p class="lead" style="color: white">
    In the end you have one of two options. You either believe that a system
    where economic growth is determined by how fast we sexualize children,
    corrode the planet, get people addicted to consumption and reduce education
    down to mechanical skills at the expense of critical thinking is sanity, and
    so you only focus on maximizing your own personal gain in that system. Or
    you can put the multiplying effect into practice and try to get as many
    people as you possibly can to ensure that justice is delivered to all humans
    on the planet.
  </p>
  <p class="lead" style="color: white">It’s up to you.</p>
  <p class="lead" style="color: white">
    You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one. Some day you might join
    us, and the world will live as one.
